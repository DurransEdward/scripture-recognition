# Datasheet

## Motivation

The raw audio data was produced by the London International Christian Church. The video transcription was produced by YouTube. The data was labelled by the project creator.

## Composition

The instances of the data are labelled chunks of text taken from the two sermons delivered at the London International Christian Church. There are a total of 56 labelled chunks of data. There is no confidential data used in this project. The sermons are publicly available on YouTube and the The London International Christian Church has granted permission for the transcripts of their sermons to be used in this project.

## Collection process

The data for this project are labelled transcriptions of two sermons delivered at the London International Christian Church. The original sermons and the transcriptions are available on YouTube at the following URLs:

- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xgQD8Lgoj4Y
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8cTEc7MKdI

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

The YouTube transcriptions contained some thing which might confuse the model (for example, the transcription contained "[ Applause ]"). Moreover, the original transcriptions contained timestamps, which are unnecessary for the models. These were both manually removed. 
 
## Uses

The specificity of the data format means it is only applicable to be used for this specific project.

## Distribution

The raw audio data and transcriptions are publicly available on YouTube. The labelled data are only in this repository. All data is being used with the explicit permission of the London Internation Christian Church.

## Maintenance

The data does not require any maintenance but could be added to by anyone keen to make the model perform better.
