John chapter 20. title of the lesson is pride is your enemy humility is your friend John chapter 20. pride is your enemy humility is your friend judging by the lack of amens we got a lot of pride in the house John chapter 20. verse 3. so Peter and the other disciples started for the tomb it's great to to kind of reflect on the death the burial and the resurrection and I I let me tell you something if you have a problem with sacrifice you got some bad attitudes about things that have happened to you perhaps you need a simple conversation with Oleg and Aliana sarokkin so you can get your heart screwed on straight right there they did an incredible job sharing with the cross means to them and for those of you visiting yes Oleg is Russian she's Ukrainian but they're unified in Christ they're unified in Christ and wherever Oleg is at I believe in you bro I believe in you sis we will evangelize all of Europe it says so Peter and the other disciples started for the tomb you know it's kind of good it's always good to go back to the cross and right here this is John you know John gives himself a nickname and I've explained this a few times he gives himself the nickname the one who Jesus loved I still find that funny I mean he's like amen for all these other guys I'm the one he loved",

Matthew chapter 11. he says this here in verse 28 come to me all you who are weary and burdened and I will give you what I will give you rest take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and humble in mind no he says I'm gentle and humble where in heart and yet the Bible teaches in Jeremiah that the human heart is deceitful and Beyond cure but here it says Jesus is gentle and humble and heart I think it's good to be friends with Jesus he's a good friend to have",

James chapter 4. we know that in John 7 35 his own Brothers didn't believe him but James finally gets some conviction after he Jesus appears to him I hope Jesus appears to you today I hope the holy spirit says something you know when you come to church like this sometimes it's not even the main speech it's something that the holy spirit says in the speech that really gets you to understand man pride is not your friend it's your enemy humility is your friend James chapter 4 . I I personally believe that James was embarrassed about his skepticism embarrassed about his his his pride in his brother being the Son of God and him not really acknowledging that fact I think he was embarrassed and so he gets convicted and that's what happens when you get convicted when you get convicted you get a conviction you don't have a convictions because you're not convicted enough you don't think you're prideful enough you're not convicted enough trust me I I don't need anyone tell me I know I am a prideful person and I'm afraid of my pride I'm very afraid of it",
